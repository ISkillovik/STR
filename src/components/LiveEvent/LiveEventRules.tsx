      <p>
        1.1 VEHICLE ELIGIBILITY Eligible models must be considered a “production
        vehicle” and have had a minimum build run of 600 units in each model
        year. Eligible body styles include: coupe, sedan, convertible or wagon

        (from the particular make and model vehicle) steel unibody and/or steel
        frame structure between the OEM front and rear suspension mounting
        points. No trucks or SUVs will be allowed. Vehicles that do not meet the
        above eligibility criteria must petition for approval from FORMULA
        DRIFT.
        <br />
        <br /> <h2>1.2 VEHICLE ELIGIBILITY INSPECTIONS</h2> <br /> 1.2.1 VEHICLE
        ANNUAL TECHNICAL INSPECTIONSPrior to the first time a vehicle is entered
        into any EVENT for the current season; the COMPETITION DIRECTOR will
        issue a FORMULA DRIFT VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION (VID) number/sticker and
        conduct an annual inspection of each vehicle. Upon verification of
        compliance to the rules, an annual tech sticker will be issued and
        affixed to the main roll bar hoop at driver’s left. Only vehicles that
        have passed the annual Inspection, and have an annual tech sticker
        affixed, will be allowed to compete unless approved by the COMPETITION
        DIRECTOR. Issuance of the tech sticker is not an endorsement of the
        performance of the vehicle, nor an indication that the vehicle meets all
        of the required Technical Specifications. The tech sticker signifies
        that the vehicle has passed the initial Safety Inspection and will be
        permitted to go on course during scheduled FORMULA DRIFT practice,
        qualifying and drift sessions. The annual tech sticker will be withheld
        from any vehicle that does not comply with the required Safety
        Specifications. If the tech sticker is withheld, it is the team’s
        responsibility to meet with the COMPETITION DIRECTOR to determine what
        action is required to achieve compliance. The COMPETITION DIRECTOR shall
        maintain inspection records of each entered vehicle. To be eligible for
        competition in an EVENT, all vehicles must have: A FORMULA DRIFT VEHICLE
        IDENTIFICATION number (VID) A current annual technical inspection
        sticker During Technical Inspection, there may only be one person from
        the team serving as a representative for the vehicle being inspected.
        The area should be closed off and private. All other personnel must
        leave area. <br />
        <br /> 1.2.2 VEHICLE EVENT TECHNICAL INSPECTIONSAt a time and place and
        in a manner determined by event officials, prior to racing activities of
        any nature (including without limitation qualifying, competition,
        practice, testing, etc.) all vehicle and driver equipment must undergo a
        technical inspection. In addition, every vehicle is subject to further
        technical inspection at any time before, during or after an event, at
        the time and in the place and manner directed by any event official.
        Formula Drift may at any time inspect, seal for inspection, and/ or tear
        down a participant’s vehicle. Not complying in full with any inspection
        request will result in disqualification for further competition and such
        other penalties as deemed appropriate by Formula Drift. All
        determinations by event officials regarding the timing and method of
        technical inspection shall be final and not subject to appeal or review.
        Technical inspection assists event officials with determining, in their
        judgment, eligibility for participation in an event. The technical
        inspection does not in any way change the fact that the driver, the
        crewmembers, and the vehicle owner are ultimately responsible for the
        safety and operation of the vehicle and equipment. The participant
        agrees that participant is in the best position to know about the
        construction and operation of participant’s vehicle, equipment, and
        clothing, and whether there has been compliance with all Formula Drift 5
        rules, regulations and agreements, including but not limited to those
        contained in the Rulebook. Moreover, in the case of technical
        violations, the participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that
        the participant is charged with full knowledge of every component of
        participant’s vehicle and that even if a third party has caused the
        participant’s vehicle to be noncompliant, the participant will still be
        responsible for and charged with any applicable violation and sanction.
        Disclaiming knowledge of the particular part or parts, or disclaiming
        knowledge of the rule or rules, or disclaiming responsibility for the
        actions of the third party, will not be defenses to any violation or any
        sanction therefor. Any means or tactic used that could deceive the
        judges or interfere with the judging process is strictly prohibited and
        will be subject to disciplinary actions.
        <br />
        <br /> 1.3 RETENTION OF VEHICLES AND PARTSParticipant hereby grants
        Formula Drift, and each of their agents and assigns, full and
        unconditional permission to collect and retain vehicles, parts of
        vehicles, equipment, or any other Items used in conjunction with
        participation that are owned by or in the possession of participant or
        present at an event (collectively “Items”), including such Items that
        may be relevant incident to the investigation of an incident; the
        inspection or testing of such Items; or for any other purpose. Formula
        Drift may exercise this right to take and retain Items at any time when
        Formula Drift determines in its sole and absolute discretion that such
        actions are necessary. Participant fully releases Formula Drift from any
        liability whatsoever for loss of, damage to, or destruction of any such
        Items. When an item is suspected of being out of compliance with a
        Formula Drift rule, or when an item has been involved in an incident,
        Formula Drift may in its sole and absolute discretion collect and retain
        such Items if Formula Drift believes it is necessary to do so to further
        investigate, make a final determination, and/or preserve evidence, all
        in Formula Drift’s sole and absolute discretion. At any time that
        Formula Drift collects and retains Items, Formula Drift will try to
        safeguard such Items and return such Items when Formula Drift has
        completed its work with them, but Formula Drift makes no representation
        or warranties that the Items will not be lost, damaged, destructively
        tested, destroyed or otherwise affected. Formula Drift is not
        responsible for payment, reimbursement, damage or loss to the
        participant as a result of compliance testing. If Formula Drift believes
        that an item should be retained or destroyed, or indefinitely or
        permanently retained, to prevent further use of such item in
        competition, Formula Drift may so retain or destroy such item.
        <br />
        <br /> 1.4 PARTICIPANT OBLIGATIONSParticipants must take whatever steps
        requested by a Formula Drift Official, including tear down of the
        vehicle and removal of parts to facilitate inspection of race equipment.
        This obligation includes, but is not limited to, installing inspection
        holes, inspections ports, and/or other means of inspections in the
        frame, roll cage bars, suspension components, and the like. Formula
        Drift is not responsible for payment, reimbursement, damage or loss to
        the participant as a result of such inspections.
        <br />
        <br /> 1.5 MAINTENANCE OF VEHICLE ELIGIBILITYIt is the responsibility of
        the team to maintain a vehicle’s eligibility.
        <br />
        <br /> 1.6 VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS Any vehicle which after being issued an
        annual technical inspection sticker by the COMPETITION DIRECTOR is
        dismantled, or modified, or in any way changed which might affect its
        safety or call into question its eligibility, or which is involved in an
        accident with similar consequences, must be re-presented by the team for
        approval. It is the responsibility of the team to notify the COMPETITION
        DIRECTOR of any modifications.
        <br />
        <br /> 1.7 VEHICLE DAMAGE If a vehicle is damaged due to an accident or
        other incident, the COMPETITION DIRECTOR may remove the annual tech
        sticker. A new tech sticker may be issued after the vehicle is
        re-inspected or repaired and then re
